# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task5

Goal: The main goal of a sales prediction system is to accurately forecast future sales for products, services, or stores based on historical data and related influencing factors.

# Libraries used
Data Handling & Analysis

pandas – data manipulation

numpy – numerical computation

Visualization

matplotlib, seaborn – EDA & trend visualization

Machine Learning

xgboost, lightgbm, catboost – gradient boosting

# Workflow

1.Data Collection

Historical sales data (date, store, product, quantity, revenue)

2.Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Normalize or scale features

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify patterns, trends, and seasonality

4.Model Selection

Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

5.Model Training

Split data into training and testing sets

6.Model Evaluation

Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²
